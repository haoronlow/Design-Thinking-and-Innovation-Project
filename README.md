# Design-Thinking-and-Innovation-Project

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the eatery scene was completed changed. Initially, all dine-in at hawker centres and other eateries were not allowed; only takeaways and deliveries were permitted. As the regulations eased off, dining in was now allowed, but with strict safe distancing measures.

However, this would mean that there would be bigger crowds in hawker centres and more interactions between one another. This has led to our group thinking of what are some areas in the hawker centres that there is a lack of safety measures in place to prevent the spread of Covid 19.

Our group have decided to tackle the issue of the tray return area being too close to the sink area as there is a lack of safe distancing between the patron using the sink and the patron returning his trays. We noticed that some patrons would remove their masks at the sink to rinse and gargle their mouths before spitting out the water. Therefore, this touch point could be a potential COVID breading grounds as the droplets from unmasked sink users can spread to those returning trays.


Our group have come up with a “Revolutionary” tray return system such that the tray return can still be next to the sink area and yet maintaining the minimum safety distancing. After many iterations of our design drawings, we have concluded that a circular shape tray return system would allow for the most trays to be collected and at the same time it would allow cleaners to know when to clear the tray return.
